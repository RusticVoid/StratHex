# What is StratHex (Name subject to change)
StratHex is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game with hexagons.

You grow and expand your city while keeping up with your energy and resources. Your goal is to grow your army and attack other players' cities.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] Map Generation
  - [ ] More then 4 player support on maps
  - [ ] Terrian (water, mountains, plains)

I do plan on adding more to this game but right now I don't really have many ideas.

## How to run
download the code and unzip it.

Run run.bat (Windows) or run.sh (Linux).
